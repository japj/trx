- portaudio use callback to record data
  - possibly use ringbuffer mechanism?

- mac check using float32, since PA uses it internally
  - opus supports _float versions of encode/decode 
- mac rx lots of "timestamp in the future detected"
- mac tx Pa Input overflowed issues

- PA duplex callback might give better latency?
  - requires tx/rx "in one"
- PA patches at audacity that are not in master portaudio tree
  - portmixer support
  - ringbuffer
  - several windows patches (jack/wasapi/mme/>16bit MME&DirectSound)

- default_addr :: -> 0.0.0.0
- update default port audio device detection (remove default macro)
- check portaudio support on linux

- check connect_mode to receive from all other hosts
  - single rx for multiple tx?

- portaudio check all playback/record devices
  - latency/quality of different devices
  
- check ortp on windows?
