NOTE 2020-04-28:
This repo contains a (start of a) port of trx to portaudio as part of
prototyping work for project "rehearsal20".

As such, this port is not finished, but gave meaningfull insights and ideas
to rewrite my whole portaudio record/playback engine for low latency purposes.
The low latency portaudio engine work will continue in another project that 
will also be a nodejs native addon and this repo will be archived for history
and note taking purposes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a port of trx to portaudio so it can be used on more platforms.

Status:
- Mac: runs, see also TODO.txt for more details
- Windows: not ported yet (needs also libortp libs)

trx is a simple toolset for broadcasting live audio. It is based on
the Opus codec <http://www.opus-codec.org/> and sends and receives
encoded audio over IP networks.

It can be used for point-to-point audio links or multicast,
eg. private transmitter links or audio distribution. In contrast to
traditional streaming, high quality wideband audio (such as music) can
be sent with low-latency and fast recovery from dropouts.

With quality audio hardware and wired ethernet, a total latency of no
more than a few milliseconds is possible.
