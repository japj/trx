trx is a simple toolset for broadcasting live audio. It is based on
the Opus codec <http://www.opus-codec.org/> and sends and receives
encoded audio over IP networks.

It can be used for point-to-point audio links or multicast,
eg. private transmitter links or audio distribution. In contrast to
traditional streaming, high quality wideband audio (such as music) can
be sent with low-latency and fast recovery from dropouts.

With quality audio hardware and wired ethernet, a total latency of no
more than a few milliseconds is possible.
